			<p>I am constantly looking to push my boundries, dive down rabbit holes and explore the unexplored. Out of college, I spent two years teaching English in Spain and cooking... a lot. My interest in food peaked when I landed back to my hometown of Chicago and started collecting data on food access in known 'food deserts'. This work led me to meeting an urban gardener, which changed my professional trajectory. I moved to LA where I could grow food year round and ended up as the Farm to Kitchen Coordinator for Homeboy Industries, the largest gang prevention and intervention provider in the US. When I moved to Hawaii after exploring more avenues to increase good food access to neighborhoods, I became more interested in politics. I worked for two members of the state capitol and was part of the Farm to School+, Cottage Foods, and Hemp working groups. Last year, I moved back to Chicago to explore another rabbit hole, the interwebs. I built my first recommender system, thanks to Coursera's Java Specialization through Duke University and my tutor who also happens to be my dad. I also worked with my dad to teach Java, C++ and Python to middle schoolers enrolled in Northwestern's Center for Talent Development. Now I am currently enrolled in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp with hopes to change careers again and dive into the tech world. </p>
